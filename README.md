# authzen
A framework for easily integrating authorization into backend services. The design philosophy of authzen was heavily influenced by [hexagonal architecture](https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749)
and aims to provide authorization primitives with the support for many different "backends".
