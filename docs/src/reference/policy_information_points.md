# Policy Information Points
A policy information point is a common component of many authorization schemes, it basically returns information about objects required for the authorization engine to make unambiguous decisisons.
Realizing that you need to implement one of these can make you feel like it's all gone too far, maybe I should just go back to simple RBAC. Authzen makes it really simple to implement one however!
More documentation for this section will come soon, but check out the example of implementing one in the [examples](https://github.com/tlowerison/authzen/tree/main/examples/cart/policy-information-point).
