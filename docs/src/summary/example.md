# Example
There is a fully running example in the [repository](https://github.com/tlowerison/authzen/tree/main/examples/cart).
It shows an example of a backend service which manages accounts, shopping items and shopping carts.
The example provides example policies for which accounts can create items, which carts an account can add items to (only their own),
and which carts an account can view the contents of (only their own).
