# Policy Information Points
A policy information point is a common component of many authorization systems, it basically returns information about objects required for the authorization engine to make unambiguous decisisons.
Authzen provides utilities that make it simple to implement a policy information point which will integrate best with your authorization engine.
More documentation for this section will come soon, but check out the example of implementing one in the [examples](https://github.com/tlowerison/authzen/tree/main/examples/cart/policy-information-point).
